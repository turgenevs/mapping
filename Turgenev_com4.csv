Sheappeared to be about thirty; her thin, pale face still contained tracesof a remarkable beauty; I was particularly taken by her eyes, so largeand melancholy. She leaned her elbows on her knees and placed herface in her hands.

Yermolay was a man of the most unusual kind: free and easyas a bird, garrulous to a fair extent, to all appearances scatter-brainedand awkward; he had a strong liking for drink, could never settle inone place, when on the move he ambled and swayed from side to side– and, ambling and swaying, he would polish off between thirty andforty miles a day. He had been involved in a most extraordinaryvariety of adventures, spending nights in marshes, up trees, on roofs,beneath bridges, more than once under lock and key in attics, cellarsand barns, relieved of his gun, his dog, his most essential clothing,receiving forceful and prolonged beatings – and yet after a short timehe would return home clothed, with his gun and with his dog.
